# Advent of Code 2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an open, international and annual programming event. Each day in the advent calendar is a programming puzzle and everyone races to solve them, or just solves them for fun. This is my first year and I'm going to solve them in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a language I'm about half-way through learning.

I've a family and hobbies and will struggle to find the time to do this. My goal isn't to be clever but to be quick.
